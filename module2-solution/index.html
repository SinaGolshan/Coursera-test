        <p>In the movie Field of Dreams, you heard, “If you build it, they will come.” That statement
            most certainly applies to the evolution of network-based services seen in modern-day
            networks. Computer networks are no longer relegated to allowing a group of computers to
            access a common set of files stored on a computer chosen as a file server. Instead, with the
            building of high-speed, highly redundant networks, network architects are seeing the wisdom
            of placing a variety of traffic types on a single network. Examples include voice and video, in
            addition to data. As you will learn in this chapter, the Internet of Things (IoT) means that just
            about everything wants to join your network, from the lights in your home to many of your
            household appliances!
